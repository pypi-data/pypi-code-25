**1. Introduction**
-------------------

Query module contains a rich set of APIs that allows you to construct powerful
queries over collections. The APIs include methods to do:

* Filter queries: Equality, Comparators, Prefix, Regex, Boolean
* Sorting: Highest N, Lowest N
* Aggregation: Min, Max, Avg, Sum, Count, Count Distinct,
Approximate Count Distinct, Collect
* Pagination: Limit with skip support
* Sampling: Sample operator
* JOINs: Lookup operator
* Graph queries: Apply operator
* Text search: Spellcheck, Proximity, Boosting

This module provides ``Q`` a query builder, and ``F`` a field reference
object to programmatically compose complex powerful queries.

Example usage
-------------
::

    from rockset import Client, Q, F

    # connect to Rockset
    api_key = 'adkjf234rksjfa23waejf2'
    rs = Client(api_key=...)
    users = rs.Collection.retrieve('users')

    # fetch user whose "_id" == "u42"
    u = users.query(F["_id"] == "u42")

    # fetch the 100 oldest users in the 'users' collection
    q = Q.all.highest(100, F["age"])
    old100 = users.query(q)

    # find the average rating of all songs by "The Beatles"
    q = Q(F["artist"] == "The Beatles").select(F["rating"].avg())
    avg_rating = users.query(q)


Let's look closely into ``F`` first.

Field reference: ``F``
----------------------

``F`` is a field reference object that helps you build query expressions
natively using Python language expressions. ``F`` uses Python operator
overloading heavily and operations on field references generate
Query_ objects that, when executed, match all documents where<
the field satisfies a specific condition.

For example::

    F["last_name"] == "Gray"

The above Python expression returns a Query_ object that selects
all documents where field ``last_name`` is equal to the string ``"Gray"``.

Here are a few more examples for other data types such as integers and floats.
::

    F["_id"] == "u42"
    F["age"] >= 18
    F["rating"] >= 4.5

The above expressions return Query_ objects that selects all
documents where field ``_id`` is equal to string ``"u42"``, field
``age`` is equal to ``18``, or field ``rating`` is greater than or
equal to ``4.5``, respectively.

=====================
Strong Dynamic Typing
=====================

Rockset does not do any implicit type conversion at query time or write time.
The original type information of every field is preserved along with every
field value and are respected at query processing time.

For example, a query ``F["age"] >= 18`` looks for all documents in which
the following three conditions are true:

#. field ``age`` is defined in the document,
#. field ``age`` has an integer value, and
#. field ``age``'s integer value is >= 18

If some documents in the collection, due to errors or bugs, does not contain
field ``age`` or the field ``age`` has a string or null value, all such
documents will not be returned for the ``F["age"] >= 18`` query above.

Similarly, a query such as ``F["last_name"] == "Gray"`` automatically matches
both the type (``string`` in this example) and value (``"Gray"`` in this
example).

========================
Nested Fields and Arrays
========================

The ``F`` field reference object can also be used to refer to fields within
nested documents and arrays using the same ``[]`` notation.

Consider a collection where documents looked like this example below::

    {
      "_id": {"u42"},
      "name": {
          "first": "James",
          "middle": "Nicholas",
          "last": "Gray" },
      "tags": [
          "ACID",
          "database locking",
          "two phase commits",
          "five-minute rule",
          "data cube",
          "turing award" ]
     }

Here is an example query to find all documents where field "name" contains a
nested field "middle" with value equal to "Nicholas"::

    F["name"]["middle"] == "Nicholas"

Similarly, for array fields, you can specify the array offset. For example,
here is a query to find all documents where the first entry in the ``tags``
array field equals ``"ACID"``::

    F["tags"][0] == "ACID"

In order to match against any element within an array field, you can use
Python's empty slice ``[:]`` notation.  For example, here is a query to
find all documents where the ``tags`` array field contains "ACID"
as one of the elements::

    F["tags"][:] == "ACID"

Another example query to find all documents where one of the values in
field ``tags`` is equal to "turing award"::

    F["tags"][:] == "turing award"


Based on the type of the value the field reference object is used with,
various operations are supported.

Query builder: ``Q``
--------------------

``Q`` is a query builder that helps you build a query object. The simplest
query object that selects all documents is ``Q.all``. The query object
that selects no documents is simply ``Q.none``. These come in handy when
you want to build a complex query object programmatically.

Consider the following example where you want to build a Query object that
checks if field ``ip_address`` matches IPs in a known blacklist,
or matches known blacklist prefixes, or matches a few known blacklist regexs::

    q = Q.none
    for ip in blacklist_ips:
        q |= F["ip_address"] == ip
    for prefix in blacklist_prefixes:
        q |= F["ip_address"].startswith(prefix)
    for regex in blacklist_regexs:
        q |= F["ip_address"].matches(regex)

Consider a different example where you want to build a Query object that checks
if the email body contains all the terms present in a target list::

    q = Q.all
    for term in target_terms:
        q &= F["email_body"][:] = term

For convenience, ``Q`` can also be wrapped around field reference expressions,
in which case it turns into an identity function. The following two expressions
are identical to each other::

    (F["first_name"] == "Jim") & (F["last_name"] == "Gray")
    Q((F["first_name"] == "Jim") & (F["last_name"] == "Gray"))

While field reference ``F`` makes it easy to represent various query selection
operators, ``Q`` allows you to compose more sophisticated operators such as
**projection**, **sorting**, **joins**, **aggregation**, and
**graph traversals**.

**2. Basic queries**
--------------------

Filter queries
--------------

=========================
Equality operator: ``==``
=========================
    Supported types: ``int``, ``float``, ``bool``, ``str``

    Syntax:
    ``<field_ref> == <value>``

    Examples:
    ::

      F["first_name"] == "Jim"
      F["year"] == 2017
      F["score"] == 5.0
      F["tags"][:] == 'critical'

===============================================
Value comparators: ``<``, ``<=``, ``>=``, ``>``
===============================================
    Supported types: ``int``

    Syntax:
    ``<field_ref> < <value>``,
    ``<field_ref> <= <value>``,
    ``<field_ref> >= <value>``,
    ``<field_ref> > <value>``

    Examples:
    ::

      F["year"] < 2000
      F["year"] >= 2007
      F["rating"] >= 4.5

===============================
Prefix operator: ``startswith``
===============================
    Supported types: ``str``

    Syntax:
    ``<field_ref>.startswith(<prefix>)``

    Examples:
    ::

      F["first_name"].startswith("Ben")
      F["tags"][:].startswith("urgent:")

===========================
Regex operator: ``matches``
===========================
    Supported types: ``str``

    Syntax:
    ``<field_ref>.matches(<regex>)``

    Examples:
    ::

      # find all "10.X.Y.Z" IP addresses
      F["ip_address"].matches("^10\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}$")

      # find all documents which has at least 1 tag with numeric characters
      # in them where the field "tags" is an array of strings
      F["tags"][:].matches("^.*\d.*$")

* Field rename: ``named``
    Supported types: All

    Syntax:
    ``<field_ref>.named(<new-field-name>)``

===============================
Field existence: ``is_defined``
===============================
    Supported types: All

    Syntax:
    ``<field_ref>.is_defined()``

    Field existence tested with ``<field_ref>.is_defined()`` will match all
    documents where the field is defined, even if it has a null value.

================================
Null comparison: ``is_not_null``
================================
    Supported types: All

    Syntax:
    ``<field_ref>.is_not_null()``

    Field expression ``<field_ref>.is_not_null()`` will match all documents
    where the field is defined and has a non-null value.

.. tip:: There is no ``is_null()`` because of the potential confusion of \
calling ``is_null()`` on an undefined field. Use \
``~<field_ref>.is_not_null()`` or ``<field_ref>.is_defined() & \
~<field_ref>.is_not_null()`` depending on your use case.

Boolean queries
---------------

Four different boolean operators (``&``, ``|``, ``~``, and ``-``) are
overloaded to allow easy composition of boolean operators.

.. note:: The boolean operators are **NOT** ``and``, ``or``, and ``not``, \
as those are special and cannot be overridden in Python.

==================================
AND operator: ``&`` (intersection)
==================================
    Syntax:
    ``<Query object> & <Query object>``

    Examples:
    ::

      # find all documents where field tags contains the "turing award"
      # and the age is greater than 40
      (F["tags"][:] == "turing award") & (F["age"] > 40)

==========================
OR operator: ``|`` (union)
==========================
    Syntax:
    ``<Query object> | <Query object>``

    Examples:
    ::

      # find all documents where the first_name is "jim"
      # or last_name is "gray"
      (F["first_name"] == "jim") | (F["last_name"] == "gray")

==============================
NOT operator: ``~`` (negation)
==============================
    Syntax:
    ``~<Query object>``

    Examples:
    ::

      # find all documents whose title does not contain the term "confidential"
      ~F["title"][:] == "confidential"

==================================
MINUS operator: ``-`` (difference)
==================================
    Syntax:
    ``<Query object> - <Query object>``

    Examples:
    ::

      # find all documents whose title contains "important"
      # and remove all docuemtns whose title contains "confidential"
      (F["title"][:] == "important") - (F["title"][:] == "confidential")


Field selection
---------------

=========================
Select operator
=========================
    Syntax:
    ``<Query>.select(<field_ref> [, <field_ref> [, ...]])``

    Allows you to specify the fields that you wish to include in the
    query results.

    Examples:
    ::

      Q(F["last_name"] == "Gray").select(F["first_name"], F["last_name"], \
F["age"])

.. automethod:: Query.select

Document selection
------------------

=========================
Where operator
=========================
    Syntax:
    ``<Query>.where(<Query>)``

    ``where`` allows you to chain a new query object as a conjuntion.
    In most cases, field reference expressions are sufficient, but
    ``where`` comes in especially handy when you want to sub-select
    documents following another operation such as a sort or an aggregation.

    Examples:
    ::

      # find all "Jim"s who are in the top 100 highest scorers
      Q.all  \\
      .highest(100, F["score"])  \\
      .where(F["first_name"] == "Jim")

.. automethod:: Query.where

--------------

**3. Advanced queries**
-----------------------

Aggregate queries
-----------------

====================================================
Aggregate operator and field ref aggregate functions
====================================================
    Syntax:
    ``<Query>.aggregate(<field_ref> [, <field_ref> [, ...]])``

    Field reference objects can also include any of the following aggregation
    functions:

    * ``min``
    * ``max``
    * ``avg``
    * ``sum``
    * ``count``
    * ``countdistinct``
    * ``approximatecountdistinct``
    * ``collect``

    You can also optionally provide a field name alias in the
    field reference using the ``named`` function. This comes in
    especially handy for the aggregated fields.

    Examples:
    ::

      # find min and max salaries broken down by age
      Q.all.aggregate(F["age"], F["salary"].min(), F["salary"].max())
      # will return documents such as:
      # {"age", "18", "min(salary)": 50000, "max(salary)": 150000}
      # {"age", "19", "min(salary)": 50000, "max(salary)": 152000}

      # example using field name alias
      Q.all.aggregate(F["age"], F["salary"].avg().named("avg_salary"))
      # will return documents such as:
      # {"age", "18", "avg_salary": 82732}

.. automethod:: Query.aggregate

.. automethod:: FieldRef.min
.. automethod:: FieldRef.max
.. automethod:: FieldRef.avg
.. automethod:: FieldRef.sum
.. automethod:: FieldRef.count
.. automethod:: FieldRef.countdistinct
.. automethod:: FieldRef.approximatecountdistinct
.. automethod:: FieldRef.collect

--------------

.. _Graph queries:

Graph queries
-------------

=========================
Apply operator
=========================
    Syntax:
    ``<Query>.apply(<field_ref>)``

    Apply operator matches all documents whose ``<field_ref>``
    value matches the results of the given ``<Query>``.

    Apply operators enable graph queries that allows you to perform
    graph traversals across related fields in different collections
    without requiring any special data shaping or schema modeling or
    graph specific indexing.

    The common pattern for using ``apply`` will look as follows:

    Step 1: Search, process and filter for relevant documents

    Step 2: Select the field that defines the source vertex

    Step 3: Apply over the field that defines the destination vertex

    Step 4: Go back to Step 1 for another graph traversal hop, if required.

    Examples:
    ::

      # Assume you have following 2 collections:
      #
      # "bad_ips" collection:
      #   {"_collection": "bad_ips", "ip_address": "106.6.6.6", "last_seen": ... }
      #   {"_collection": "bad_ips", "ip_address": "107.6.6.6", "last_seen": ... }
      #
      # "login_attempts" collection:
      #   {"_collection": "login_attempts", "login_ip": "72.43.99.108", ... }
      #   {"_collection": "login_attempts", "login_ip": "106.6.6.6", ... }
      #
      # You can model the above 2 collections as a graph, where there exists
      # an edge between every login_attempts.login_ip and the corresponding
      # bad_ips.ip_address
      #
      # The following query will find all login_attempts from any of the
      # bad_ips:
      rs = Client()
      results = rs.query( Q("bad_ips")  \\
                               .select(F["ip_address"])  \\
                               .apply(F["login_ip"], Q("login_attempts")) )

      # the slow and inefficient way to achive the same would be to
      # materialize the list of all bad_ips and then building out a
      # new query object which could potentially be quite big.
      # DO NOT USE THIS. USE APPLY OPERATOR INSTEAD.
      bad_ips = rs.query(Q("bad_ips"))
      suspicious_logins = Q.none
      for bad_ip in bad_ips:
          suspicious_logins |= (F["login_ip"] == bad_ip["ip_address"])

      # execute the query against "login_attempts"
      results = rs.query(Q("login_attempts").where(suspicious_logins))


    Another example:
    ::

      # Assume you have following 3 collections:
      # "users"
      # {"_id": "u42", "name": "Patrick", "zip": "94107"}
      # {"_id": "u67", "name": "Paul", "zip": "94306"}
      #
      # "merchants"
      # {"_id": "m2345", "name": "Muddy Waters", "zip": "53706"}
      # {"_id": "m8442", "name": "Beli Deli", "zip": "94002"}
      #
      # "payments"
      # {"_id": "p23rsdkjkapw3", "payer": "u42", "merchant": "m2345", "amount": 17.45, "time": 1488244768}
      # {"_id": "qase8432akdfa", "payer": "u67", "merchant": "m8442", "amount": 42.72, "time": 1488244807}
      # {"_id": "r23raskdfa235", "payer": "u42", "merchant": "m8442", "amount": 11.83, "time": 1488244942}
      # {"_id": "s06slkgeka92s", "payer": "u42", "merchant": "m8442", "amount": 10000, "time": 1488244944}
      #

      # find all merchants in zip code 53706,
      # then find all of their payments,
      # then find the top 100 users by total amount spent
      merchants = Q("merchants").where(F["zip"] == "53706")
      payments  = merchants.select(F["_id"]).apply(F["merchant"], Q("payments"))
      all_users = payments.aggregate(F["payer"], F["amount"].sum().named("total_amount"))
      top_users = all_users.highest(10, F["total_amount"])

      # execute the top_users query
      rs = Client()
      results = rs.query(top_users)

.. automethod:: Query.apply

--------------

JOINs
-----

=========================
Lookup operator
=========================

    Syntax:
    ``<Query>.lookup(<local_field_ref> \
[, <target_field_ref>] \
[, <target_query_ref>] \
[, <new_field_ref>])``

    Lookup operator allows you to perform a LEFT OUTER JOIN between results
    of the current ``<Query>`` object and the results of the
    ``<target_query_ref>``.

    The LEFT OUTER JOIN operation will be performed on the
    ``<local_field_ref>`` from the results of the current ``<Query>`` object
    and the ``<target_field_ref>`` in ``<target_query_ref>``.

    The output of the JOIN operation will be presented as an array value
    within the ``<new_field_ref>`` in the post JOIN results.

    Examples:
    ::

      # Assume you have following 2 collections:
      #
      # "employees" collection:
      #   {"_collection": "emp", "_id": "e42",
      #       "name": "Jim Gray", "deptId": "d7" }
      #   {"_collection": "emp", "_id": "e43",
      #       "name": "Peter Parker", "deptId": "d8" }
      #   {"_collection": "emp", "_id": "e44",
      #       "name": "Jane Doe", "deptId": null }
      #   {"_collection": "emp", "_id": "e45",
      #       "name": "John Smith" }
      #
      # "dept" collection (only has "d7" but no "d8"):
      #   {"_collection": "dept", "_id": "d7", "name": "eng" }
      #

      # fetch all employees along with their relevant dept records
      rs = Client()
      q = Q("emp").lookup(F["deptId"], target_field=F["_id"],
              target_query=Q("dept"))
      everyone = rs.query(q)

      # the above query will return the following results:
      #
      # [ {"_collection": "emp", "_id": "e42",
      #       "name": "Jim Gray", "deptId": "d7",
      #       "deptId:lookup":
      #           [ {"_collection": "dept", "_id": "d7", "name": "eng"} ]
      #   },
      #   {"_collection": "emp", "_id": "e43",
      #       "name": "Peter Parker", "deptId": "d8",
      #       "deptId:lookup": [ ]
      #   },
      #   {"_collection": "emp", "_id": "e44",
      #       "name": "Jane Doe", "deptId": null,
      #       "deptId:lookup": null
      #   },
      #   {"_collection": "emp", "_id": "e45",
      #       "name": "John Smith"
      #   }
      # ]


    Another example:
    ::

      # another query on the same two collections described above
      # example to fetch name of employee "u42" along with their dept name
      #
      # first define target_query to only select dept id (JOIN field) and name
      target_query = Q("dept").select(F["_id"], F["name"])

      #
      # LEFT OUTER JOIN between employee "u42" and target_query
      # Note: default target_field '_id' works here and is not specified
      jim = Q("emp").where(F["_id"] == "u42").lookup(
                local_field=F["deptId"],
                target_query=target_query,
                new_field=F["dept"])

      #
      # only select relevant fields post JOIN
      jim = jim.select(F["name"], F["dept"])

      # execute the query
      rs = Client()
      everyone = rs.query(jim)

      # the above query will return the following results:
      # [ { "name": "Jim Gray", "dept": [ {"_id": "d7", "name": "eng"} ]
      #   }
      # ]

.. automethod:: Query.lookup

--------------

Nested queries
--------------

=========================
Nested operator
=========================
    Syntax:
    ``<field_ref>.nested(<Query>)``

    ``nested`` operator makes it easy to work with nested array of documents.

    Examples:

    ::
      # find all books authored by 'Jim Gray'
      F["authors"][:].nested((F["first_name") == "Jim") \
& (F["last_name"] == "Gray"))

      # find all users who logged in from given IP on June 06, 2006
      F["logins"][:].nested((F["ipv4"] == "10.6.6.6") \
& (F["login_date"] == "2006-06-06"))


.. automethod:: FieldRef.nested

--------------

Pagination queries
------------------

=========================
Limit operator
=========================
    Syntax:
    ``<Query>.limit(<max_results> [, <skip_count>])``

    Limit operator allows you to perform pagination queries and positional
    filters.

    Examples:
    ::

      # find the "_id" field of the 5 most recently uploaded documents
      # since the default sorting is more recently updated first,
      # this query will simply be:
      Q.all.limit(5)

      # fetch a third batch of 100 results, for all users older than 18
      # i.e., skip the first 200 results
      Q(F["age"] >= 18).limit(100, skip=200)

.. automethod:: Query.limit

--------------

Sampling queries
----------------

=========================
Sample operator
=========================
    Syntax:
    ``<Query>.sample(<ratio>)``

    Sample operator allows you to uniformly sample the results of an
    inner query.

    Examples:
    ::

      # return 1% of all documents
      Q.all.sample(0.01)
      Q.all.sample(1/100)

      # fetch 10% of all users older than 18
      Q(F["age"] >= 18).sample(0.1)

.. automethod:: Query.sample

--------------

Sort queries
------------

=========================
Highest, Lowest operators
=========================
    Syntax:
    ``<Query>.highest(N, <field_ref> [, <field_ref> [, ...]])``,
    ``<Query>.lowest(N, <field_ref> [, <field_ref> [, ...]])``

    Examples:
    ::

      Q(F["last_name"] == "Gray").highest(5, F["score"], F["first_name"])
      Q(F["last_name"] == "Gray").lowest(10, F["salary"])

Text search
-----------

=========================
Search operator
=========================

    Syntax:
    ``<Query>.search(<Query> [, <Query> [, ...]])``

    Examples::

      Q.all.search(
          F["title"].proximity("game of thrones").boost(1.5),
          F["article_body"].proxmity("game of thrones").boost(1.0),
          (F["popular"] == "yes").boost(3.0))

    You can perform a text search against an analyzed field using the search
    method. A list of search conditions can be supplied as input and the
    search method will perform a Weak AND over all the given conditions.

    Unlike boolean AND queries that will only return if **all** the
    conditions are met, search queries perform a Weak AND, where documents
    that satisfy more search conditions will be ranked higher than
    the ones that match fewer.

    Use the ``boost`` operator if different search conditions need to be
    weighed differently.

        Comes in handy while working with nested array of documents.

        Say you have a collection where every document describes a book,
        and each document has an "authors" field that is a nested array of
        documents describing each author::

            {"title": "Transaction Processing: Concepts and Techniques",

                 {"first_name": "Jim", "last_name": "Gray"},
                 {"first_name": "Andreas", "last_name": "Reuter"},
             ],
             "publisher": ... }

        If you want to do find all books where 'Jim Gray' was one of the
        authors, you can use the following query::

            F["authors"][:].nested((F["first_name"] == 'Jim') \
& (F["last_name"] == 'Gray'))

        Note: Constructing the same query as follows is incorrect::

            # CAUTION: This is not same as the query above
            (F["authors"][:]["first_name"] == 'Jim') \
& (F["authors"][:]["last_name"] == 'Gray')

        The incorrect version will return all books which has at least one
        author with first name 'Jim' and at least one author with last name
        'Gray', but it need not be the same author. A book with two authors
        named 'Jim Smith' and 'Alice Gray' will also match, which is not what
        is intended.

        Also comes in handy if you want to build a complex expressions on a
        nested document. Say a document has field "address", which has nested
        fields such as "door_number", "street", "city", "state", "zip" etc.
        If you want to find all documents with address in "San Francisco" or
        any one of San Francisco's zip codes, you can simply do::

            q = F["city"] == "San Francisco"
            for sf_zip in sf_zips:
                q = q | F["zip"] == sf_zip
            q = F["address"].nested(q)

        The above query is equivalent to::

            q = F["address"]["city"] == "San Francisco"
            for sf_zip in sf_zips:
                q = q | F["address"]["zip"] == sf_zip

        Args:
            nested_query (Query): query expression to run on every nested \
            document present within the given field path

        Returns:
