"""pkgscript.py

    Python module that allows a packaged module to run properly as a script.

    Calling this function in a packaged module (running as a script) will
    import the script's parent package(s),
    allowing the script to import other modules from the same package family
    (using either explicit relative or absolute import statements).

    !!! This function must be called before any package-sibling imports !!!

    Examples:

        ### Milo.mod_script.py
        import pkgscript
        # Only call function if module is being run as a script
        if (__name__ == "__main__") and (__package__ is None):
            pkgscript.import_parent_packages("Milo", globals())
        from Milo.version import __version__
        from .version import __version__    # same as previous line

        ### top_pkg.sub_pkg.sub_sub_pkg.mod_script.py
        import pkgscript
        # Only call function if module is being run as a script
        if (__name__ == "__main__") and (__package__ is None):
            pkgscript.import_parent_packages(
                "top_pkg.sub_pkg.sub_sub_pkg", globals())
        # Import top_pkg.sub_pkg.other_module
        from top_pkg.sub_pkg import other_module
        from .. import other_module    # same as previous line
        from ...sub_pkg import other_module    # same as previous line
