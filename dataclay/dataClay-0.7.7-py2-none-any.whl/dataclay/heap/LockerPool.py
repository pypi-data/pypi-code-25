        Locking design.
        ==============
        If we are using CPython as interpreter, GIL can 'stop' current thread in the middle of a serialization and 
        start sleeping thread in the middle of other action in same object and we can have race conditions or many other
        problems. Therefore we need to lock the objects. 
        
        CPython guarantees that get/put in maps are atomic but not 'get and create if needed'. In our case,
        imagine the code below and two threads located in the lines specified as comments:
        
        if not self.lockers.has_key(object_id): #ObjectID is the same for both threads 
            lock = threading.RLock() #Thread 2 is here
            self.lockers.put(object_id, lock) #Thread 1 is here 

        Thread 1 was the first to arrive and find out that there is no locker for the object "he" wants to lock. Therefore,
        Thread 1 creates a new locker. During creation of the Locker, Thread 2 arrives and find no locker.
        Thread 1 put the locker in the ConcurrentHashMap. Thread 2 also creates a locker and overrides Thread 1's locker.
        This is a problem we should solve since both threads are using differents lockers for the same object, loosing the
        concept of lockers.
        
        
        In order to solve that we need to create an atomic set of operations, from now on called "synchronized block of code". 
        We could create a synchronized block based in ObjectID since Threads accessing/creating lockers 
        with same ObjectIDs can have a problem. However, our current implementation does NOT
        guarantee that two ObjectIDs representing same ID (ie with same UUID) are the same instances in memory.
        Therefore we cannot create a synchronized block using ObjectID. We could think about forcing all ObjectIDs to be
        unique ("same-instances") in memory (only one instance of ObjectID representing an object) but it ends in having same 
        synchronization but during the creation of the ObjectID (it can be in any request). Now, adding the synchronized block here is better
        in order to only lock 'if-needed' instead of doing it at creation time.
        
        Then, what should we synchronize? Anything that is 'common' for all threads. In our case, the Locker Pool is unique
        per runtime (server or client). For example:
        
        
        self.lock.acquire() #Lock is created during construction of the LockerPool, "lock = threading.RLock()" It's a reentrant lock!
        if not self.lockers.has_key(object_id): 
            lock = threading.RLock() 
            self.lockers.put(object_id, lock)        
        self.lock.release()
    
        
        This would solve our problem. But it's a bottleneck! All threads that wants to lock anything, will end up locking
        the pool. Since our problem is just at 'creation' of lockers we move the synchronized block inside the if and we
        apply the design of 'double-check' of lockers:
        
        if not self.lockers.has_key(object_id): 
            self.lock.acquire() # ensure only one locker is created per object
            if not self.lockers.has_key(object_id): 
                lock = threading.RLock() 
                self.lockers.put(object_id, lock)  
            self.lock.release()
        else:
            lock = self.lockers.get(object_id)

        
        All threads that try to 'create' lockers are going to have the overhead of synchronizing the locker pool. However,
        it is not our critical path, since in our critical path everything is in cache and lockers exist.
