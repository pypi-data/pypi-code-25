This module helps developers work with the Agresso Unit4 (ver. Milestone 4) Query Engine
SOAP webservice easily without worry about the transport layer/protocol and getting data in easible
ingestible formats: JSON, CSV

Example:
    ```python
    from pyagresso.api import Agresso
    username = os.getenv('AGRESSO_USERNAME')
    password = os.getenv('AGRESSO_PASSWORD')
    client = os.getenv('AGRESSO_CLIENT')
    instance_url = os.getenv('AGRESSO_INSTANCE_URL')
    ag = Agresso(username, password,client,instance_url)
    about_response_as_xml = ag.about()
    ```

Todo:
    * Add methods to get response as JSON
    * Add methods to get response as CSV
    * Add internal helpers to parse xml (schema+records)
    * Make QueryEngine methods into submodule and add capability for extension into other Agresso modules
    * Version the SDK for various Agresso releases

Note: 
    * Not using bdd in this library due to small size of module undertest
